      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Led three projects performing systematic modelling of multi-wavelength, multi-scale datasets of protostellar jets from AMI, e--MERLIN \& GMRT to disentangle competing radiation processes and investigate the jet launching mechanism.}

        \item {Published the first investigations of YSOs at metre wavelengths and pioneered to characterise this very long wavelength emission through follow-up observing campaigns on the GMRT and LOFAR.}
